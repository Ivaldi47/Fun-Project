- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Ivaldi47
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in 3D Modeling and Engineering
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m an Undergraduate Mechannical Engineering student, using my spare-time to learn Novice-level Web Development (FOR FUN ONLY)
- ðŸ“« How to reach me : Currently there's no other way of contacting me beside GitHub, but if the project is growing significantly then a community forum will be made. I'm also planning to make an app, hopefully.

(Edit 29th May 2023) : Day 3 Learning (Self-Thought) to create a website, Thank You The Odin Project and freecodecamp for making this possible.
